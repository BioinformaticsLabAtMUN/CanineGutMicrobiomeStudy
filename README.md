# CanineGutMicrobiomeStudy
Companion scripts for the manuscript "Gut microbiome composition is related to anxiety and aggression score in companion dogs." by Sarita Pellowe et al. (2023) (under review)

To run the Dada2_script.R you need to download the fastq files available at the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under BioProject PRJNA1020865.

For convenience we have uploaded the files obtained by the Dada2 Analysis in the [Data directory](https://github.com/BioinformaticsLabAtMUN/CanineGutMicrobiomeStudy/tree/main/Data). All the files needed to run the other analyses are available in this Data directory. The other scripts (PhiLR_selbal.R, AbundanceAnalysis.R and RandomForest.R) can be run independently of each other. Note that there are comments in the scripts indicating whether something has to be changed depending on whether the analysis is for Aggression or Anxiety.
